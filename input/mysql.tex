\subsection{Conclusion:}
These are two way converters which converts two file formats into each other according to the user's requirement. The file format conversion is strictly done on the basis of file format spcifications. Also the conversion goes through various phases among which reading and parsing the input file, and writing the output file are major. Also the converter is platform independent as it converts the files of softwares which are for different platforms that is STAAD-PRO, which is a Windows based Fem software and FELT, which is an open source software.

\subsection{Future Scope:}
A general purpose converter can be developed by integrating all these converters and including many other file formats which can be embedded in any CAD or FEM software or can be used independtly.
